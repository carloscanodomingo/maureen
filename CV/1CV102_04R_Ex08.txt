Currently clinical trials are being carried out using recombinant human IL-10. These clinical trials have targeted diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, organ transplantation, and chronic hepatitis (Mocellin et al., 2003), (Asadullah et al,. 1999). Clinical trials yet need to be conducted to investigate IL-10 and its impact during heart failure. Current studies as discussed above indicate that IL-10 produces an anti-inflammatory effect and has the ability to act as a main suppressor of cellular immunity (De Waal Malefyt et al., 1992). The findings from these studies, collectively have raised questions if IL-10 expression could reduce pathological hypertrophy in the heart. Although, the complex nature of the inflammatory response has presented significant challenges to develop effective and targeted treatments.

Despite these significant challenges to develop effective and targeted treatments IL-10 therapeutic strategies have grown in the past few decades. Data extrapolated from the numerous studies have identified IL-10 as a key player in regulating the inflammatory response and slowing down the progression of heart failure, although it is still unclear whether there is a direct effect of IL-10 via activation of the receptor in cardiomyocytes or whether the effect is secondary due to the reduction of an inflammatory response. This study is designed to also investigate the direct effect of IL-10 via activation of the receptor.

1.8.4. IL-10 RECEPTOR ACTIVATION

Il-10 activity is mediated by its specific cell surface receptor complex. IL-10 binds to  the receptor which consists of two identical ligand-binding subunits; IL-10 receptor 1  (IL-10R1)  and IL-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) (Donnelly et al., 1999), as demonstrated in Figure 1.5. The IL-  10 receptor consists of two different chains, a (Ho et al., 1993) and ? chains (CRFB4) (Kotenko et al., 1997), which are both members of the IFN-y class II cytokine receptor family. The IFN-y receptor and the IL-10R possess many similarities for example they are both capable of antagonising each other effects. [Figure 1.5 removed]


The IL-10R1 is ubiquitously expressed on the surface of the cells and is known as the ligand- binding domain. Studies have shown IL-10R1 to be expressed in low levels on hematopoietic cells and up-regulated following pathological stimuli on non-hematopoietic cells like fibroblasts and epithelial cells. The IL-10R2 is mostly expressed on mast cells  and  haematopoietic cells  and is responsible for downstream signal transduction. Cardiomyocytes also activate IL-10 receptors, although non-myocytes  constitute the major  source of  the receptors. Weber-Nordt    et al (1994) study identified that the endotoxin result in an increase in the expression of IL-10R on fibroblasts although following T cell stimulation with anti-CD3-antibodies a decrease of IL- 10R gene expression has been found (Liu et al., 1994). 

The binding of IL-10 with IL-10R1/ IL-10R2 has recently been characterised and seems to be highly complex (Reineke et al., 1999). The Binding of IL-10 to IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 activate the Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling pathway, this is the signalling pathway of interest during this PhD study. The STAT3 signalling pathway activates the transcription of cytoprotective molecules. The Binding of IL-10 requires both IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 to activate the downstream signal transduction. Josephson et al (2001) have demonstrated that there was no interaction or  complexes formed between  IL-10  and the IL-  10R without the presence of both IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 present. Spencer  et  al (1998)  found  that the IL-10R-? chain is essential for IL-10-mediated effects and IL-10R- ? deficient mice display the same phenotype as IL-10 deficient mice. Cells that only expressed IL-10R-?, demonstrated that there was no interaction between the IL-10 and IL-10R, resulting in no complexes formed. Spencer et al (1998) found that only cells with  both  the  IL-10Ra and ? chain could activate STAT3 signalling pathway.

As previously discussed the activation IL-10 binds to the extracellular domain of receptor complex IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 which then activates Janus tyrosine  Kinase.  There  are  two types of Janus tyrosine Kinase, JAK1 and Tyk2. IL-10R2 activates Tyk2 and IL-10R1 activates JAK1 which then phosphorylates the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-10R1 enabling the binding of STAT3 molecule. Phosphorylation then activates STAT3 which is released from the receptor complex IL-10R1. Once the STAT3 molecule has been dislodged it translocates to the nucleus where it binds to STAT3 binding elements  to  promote various  protective genes  (Donnelly et al., 1999). STAT3 induces expression of target genes such as Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase (TIMP-3), both genes have shown to have protective properties during hypertrophy (Kunisada et al., 2000) (see figure 1.5). STAT3 also induces the expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) which controls the quality and quantity of STAT3 released (Diehl et al., 2002). SOCS3 has also shown to exert a negative regulatory effect on the different cytokines. This pathway is demonstrated in Figure 1.6.

Complex vascular remodelling processes are the substrate and hallmark of vascular diseases like atherosclerosis, post-angioplasty restenosis and pulmonary artery hypertension but are also essential to maintain vascular integrity or to regenerate vascular structures where needed such as during pregnancy (Baines et al., 2005). Acute and chronic inflammation responses characterize the cardiac hypertrophic remodelling processes in atherosclerosis, restenosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and angiogenesis. The functional, phenotypic changes, Cellular adaption and functional reprogramming in diverse vascular cell types are mediated by various complex signalling cascades that initiate and control genetic reprogramming. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been extensively described as a central signalling molecule that controls cellular adaption in response to environmental stimuli or stress in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and circulating/inflammatory cells (Hattori et al., 2001). STAT3 has shown to plays a key role in the initiation and continuation of these pathophysiological changes. This study will aims to highlight the pivotal involvement of STAT3 in the pathological cardiac remodelling processes and discusses potential translational therapies, which target STAT3 signalling via IL-10, to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases.

1.9. THE ACTIVATION OF THE STAT3 SIGNALLING PATHWAY IN THE CARDIOMYOCYTES

The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a member of the STAT family, there are seven STAT proteins currently identified, which have all been found to be expressed in the heart and in cardiomyocytes (Hilfiker-Kleiner et al., 2005) The STAT family members include; STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6 (Santos et al., 2011). The STAT3 protein has recently emerged as the key co-ordinators to balance the specific pattern of distinct stress signals that are involved in the shift from protective hypertrophy to adverse and detrimental pathological hypertrophy. This PhD project will focus on the STAT3 signalling pathway activated by IL-10 and the effects on the heart during pathological hypertrophy. CV102008 1095
