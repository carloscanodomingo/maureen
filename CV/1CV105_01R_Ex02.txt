In transgenic mice that expressed Tbx3 ectopically throughout the heart, chamber formation became dysfunctional, Nppa and Cx40 expression was repressed, however Hcn4 was not yet activated.14

Another study examined transgenic mice deficient in Tbx3.16 Again, deficiency did not prevent the SAN from forming and Hcn4 was still expressed, but the SAN was significantly smaller than in wild type mice. At day 12.5 in Tbx3 deficient embryos, Nppa and Cx40 remained inactivated in the developing SAN, presumed to be because Nkx2-5 was not yet present in this region, but another atrial gap junction gene Cx43 did encroach upon the SAN border. However, by day 13.5 Nppa, Cx40 and Cx43 were all now being expressed in the SAN. In addition, the atrial Na+ channel Nav1.5 (expressed by the gene Scn5a) normally absent from the SAN was also ectopically induced in Tbx3 deficient mice.16

The same group also examined mice ectopically expressing Tbx3.16 They showed downregulation of the working myocardial genes Nppa, Cx40, Cx43 along with Nav1.5 and the atrial K+ channel Kir2.1. They also saw upregulation of pacemaker genes for Hcn1, Hcn2 and Hcn4 along with the SAN T-type Ca2+ channel Cav3.1.16 They then used an 'aMhc' line of transgenic mouse that expressed Tbx3 ectopically but for a shorter period in early embryogenesis prior to and during chamber differentiation. These mice again demonstrated downregulation of Nppa and Cx40, but this time Hcn4 was not affected. They concluded that Tbx3 functioned as a repressor of the atrial gene program, but that the eventual promotion of pacemaker genes such as Hcn4 was via an indirect pathway.16

A homeobox gene called Shox2 has been described, seen to be restricted to the SV in the embryonic mouse heart.17, 18 Shox2 is seen to be expressed from day 8.5 and remains consistently specific to the developing SAN at day 12.5. The function of Shox2 was examined using Shox2 deficient mice.18 Null mutation of Shox2 was lethal due to severe hypoplasia of the developing SV, atrial malformation and severe bradycardia between day 11.5 and 12.5.18 By day 11.5 Shox2 deficiency was associated with upregulation of Nkx2-5, Nppa and Cx40, along with downregulation of Tbx3 and Hcn4.18 As such, Shox2 was purported to function upstream of Nkx2-5 as its repressor. However, a specific binding site between Shox2 and Nkx2-5 was not found suggesting an indirect effect.18

Pitx2c is a homeobox gene which directs the differentiation of the left and right sides of the heart.14 In Pitx2c deficient mice by day 10.5, embryos develop two sets of venous valves and sinus horns, and by day 15.5 a second left-sided SAN develops complete with a nodal artery and typical Hcn4 positive, Cx40 negative gene expression.14 It is therefore suggested that Pitx2c acts as a repressor of SAN development, upstream of Shox2 (figure 2). 14, 18

Tbx18 is a T-box transcription factor (proteins that direct limb and heart development) that is seen early in the developing SV from day 9.5 in the mouse embryo.19, 20 As Nkx2-5 positive myocardium develops, a separate pool of mesenchymal progenitor cells remain at the caudal pole of the heart tube which express Tbx18 but not Nkx2-5.19 When these cells are isolated and cultured they develop into Hcn4 positive, Nkx2-5 negative myocardium.20 Lineage analysis studying the fate of Tbx18 positive and Nkx2-5 positive cells show that they always remain mutually exclusive, with only Tbx18 expressing cells going on to form the SAN.19, 20 Furthermore, neither Nkx2-5 or Tbx18 deficient mice demonstrated any derepression of the other gene suggesting that both genes are regulated by other upstream factors.19 Tbx18 deficient mice fail to form sinus horns from the SV.20 From day 12.5 early SAN tissue fails to enlarge and the core SAN "head" is malformed.20 This suggests therefore that Tbx18 is required for the morphogenesis of the SAN head upon which Tbx3 later exerts its pacemaker program of genes.10, 20

1.2 Structure of the sinoatrial node

In general the SAN is seen as a length of tissue within the posterior wall of the RA, beginning close to where the superior vena cava (SVC) feeds into the RA and extends down beside the crista terminalis (CT) towards the inferior vena cava (IVC) (figure 3).21 There is variability in the exact location, size and shape of the SAN between humans and smaller mammals.22 [Figure 2 removed]

The SAN is much larger than originally thought and structurally more complex than the dot it is often represented by in some texts. The histologically defined human SAN ranges from 8-21.5 mm in length.21 The main body is crescent-shaped with a thinner tail of tissue extending towards the IVC, positioned 0.1 - 1 mm subepicardially.21 Groups of nodal cells are bound by basement membrane and densely packed within fibrous connective tissue.21, 23 In humans there is no discrete outer layer of fibrous tissue insulating the SAN, unlike ventricular parts of the CCS.21 The proportion of connective tissue is higher in larger animals and up to 70% in humans, increasing with age.24 Nodal cells are spindle- shaped, pale, small (about 5-10 ?m) and relatively 'empty' of myofibrils (actin and myosin chains involved in cell contraction) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (intracellular networks of membranes storing Ca2+) compared to that of the surrounding muscular tissue.23 Networks of t-tubules (deep invaginations of the cell membrane that promote
co-ordinated intracellular Ca2+ release) are also less developed in SAN cells compared to working myocytes.25

Towards the edge of the node the border becomes indiscrete and there are several theories for this. There may be intermingling of nodal and atrial muscle cells with a gradual shift in the ratio of nodal to atrial cells (mosaic effect).26 Interlocking digits of SAN and working myocardial tissue have also been seen.21 Furthermore, the morphology of the cells themselves may gradually change between nodal and atrial cell types, with intermediate cell types comprising mixed features in between (gradient effect).23, 26 All three aspects may exist simultaneously. In humans a large "paranodal area" has also been observed inferolaterally to the SAN with mixed features of both SAN and atrial tissue which may play a role in subsidiary pacemaking or propagation of SAN activity into the atrium.27

Transitional tissue in the peripheral SAN overcomes the 'source-sink mismatch', the SAN being a source of low amplitude and the atrium being a large sink that might otherwise absorb SAN activity with little effect. CV10502 1049
