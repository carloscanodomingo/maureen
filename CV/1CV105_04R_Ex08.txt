Cav1.2 is an L-type Ca2+ channel important in the phase 0 upstroke of the SAN AP.55 Ageing guinea-pigs demonstrated a decline in Cav1.2 progressing from the SAN centre outwards, increasing sensitivity to the Ca2+ blocker nifedipine and reducing spontaneous SAN activity.166 Ageing rats showed decreased levels of RYR2 and HCN1, lower intrinsic heart rate, prolonged APD and prolonged cSNRT.167 Lastly, ageing mice demonstrated bradycardia and prolonged SACT associated with reduced expression of HCN1, HCN4, Nav1.5 and many other K+ and Ca2+ channels.168 

In summary ageing is associated with remodelling of both structural and molecular features and so the cause of idiopathic SND in the elderly is probably a combination of many factors.
1.4.1 Sinus node dysfunction and tachyarrhythmia

Paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation (AF) are often seen in association with SND. This can result in excessively fast as well as slow heart rates and therefore termed 'tachy-brady syndrome'. Some patients with SND demonstrate atrial remodelling including atrial enlargement, increased refractoriness and prolonged conduction times, predisposing to re-entrant circuit formation and increasing risk of AF.160 SND could therefore be a prodrome of AF.

Conversely, chronic AF may predispose to SND. Patients with tachy-brady syndrome who flip between a fast AF rhythm and sinus bradycardia have demonstrated a caudal shift in the leading SAN pacemaker and reduced sensitivity to ?-adrenergic stimulation.36 A common treatment for persistent AF is electrical cardioversion, passing a short burst of DC current through the heart using a defibrillator to try to restore sinus rhythm. Once reverted these patients often demonstrate bradycardia and prolonged cSNRT.179 Furthermore, the degree of post-cardioversion SNRT is thought to indicate the level of atrial remodelling and therefore predict the likelihood of AF recurrence.180 Over time following cardioversion, SAN function can return to normal which suggests reversibility of AF-induced SAN remodelling.181 This remodelling may involve changes in expression of HCN channels. In a canine model of atrial tachycardia where dogs were artificially paced at 400 bpm, HCN2 and HCN4 were downregulated in the SAN by >50%, and If density was reduced by 48%.169 20 Hz atrial pacing in dogs has also been shown to lead to prolonged SNRT and bradycardia, reducing maximal and intrinsic heart rate.182
1.4.2 Familial sinus node dysfunction
Genotyping rare cases of familial SND has led to the discovery of specific gene mutations and associated channelopathies, allowing insight into their role in normal SAN function. DNA sequencing was used to screen patients with bradycardic phenotypes focusing on several candidate pacemaker genes.

Several families with inherited bradycardia were screened for point mutations or deletions within the Hcn4 gene.85-87, 170, 171 One patient with idiopathic SND was found to have a heterozygous single base deletion within Hcn4 leading to a truncated C-terminus.85 This mutant Hcn4 gene was then transduced in vitro in COS-7 cells which demonstrated If insensitive to increased cAMP levels.85 Three other families each exhibited three different Hcn4 mutations that when transduced in vitro expressed HCN4 channels with more negative MDPs.86, 87, 170 A group of Moroccan-Jewish patients exhibited a novel Hcn4 point mutation that also led to HCN4 channels with more negative MDPs.171 Many of these studies suggested an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern. Each mutation changed HCN channel structure in a unique way, highlighting how numerous anomalies can lead to incorrect channel functionality and affect heart rate.

Scn5a gene mutations lead to dysfunction of the Nav1.5 channel, known to be associated with many cardiac diseases including long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation in addition to SND.172 Nav1.5 exists in many different areas of the heart which is why patients with Scn5a mutations can present with a syndrome of multiple phenotypes.172 Since Nav1.5 exists at the SAN periphery rather than its centre, dysfunction of this channel can lead to conduction slowing into the surrounding atrium, SAN exit block and sinus arrest.172, 183 Several different types of Scn5a
mutation are associated with SND with a suggested autosomal-recessive pattern of inheritance.172

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited condition associated with sudden death in young patients as it causes stress-induced ventricular tachycardia leading to syncope and cardiac arrest. Two gene mutations are implicated, those for RYR2 and calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2), both involved with intracellular Ca2+ cycling. Patients exhibit sinus bradycardia with otherwise normal ECGs.173, 174 Bradycardia is thought to be due to dysfunctional SR Ca2+ release and disruption of the Ca2+ clock.174 Inherited RYR2 mutations show an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance, whereas most cases of CASQ2 mutations are autosomal-recessive.174

Ankyrin-B (AnkB) is a protein involved in anchoring certain ion channels to the cell membrane such as Na+/K+-ATPase, NCX and inositol triphosphate receptor 3 (IP3) and can therefore be implicated in dysfunction of these channels.184 Mutations are associated with CPVT, long QT-syndrome and SND.184 One study reports on two families demonstrating long QT intervals, histories of sudden death, AF and pacemaker implantation due to severe bradycardia.175 Heterozygous AnkB mutations in transgenic mice were linked to severe SND associated with abnormal localisation and reduced expression of NCX1, Na+/K+-ATPase, IP3 and Cav1.3.175
1.4.3 Athletes and sinus node dysfunction
Endurance athletes often exhibit significant bradycardia as a result of exercise training, with one of the lowest resting heart rates belonging to five-time Tour de France winner Miguel Indurian recorded at 28 bpm. Other notable bradycardic athletes include Mo Farah, Usain Bolt, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Sir Chris Hoy and Sir Steve Redgrave all with resting rates in their 30s. A slow resting heart rate is therefore associated with fitness however some athletes have been known to go on to need pacemaker implantation later in life suggesting that this bradycardia is not merely compensating for increased cardiac output.185 There is also a higher incidence of AF in athletes.186 Bradycardia in athletes is normally put down to high vagal tone i.e. is thought to be neurally mediated. However 'intrinsic heart rate', revealed by full autonomic pharmacologic blockade, has been shown to be lower in exercise trained individuals implicating electrical remodelling of the SAN.187

Heart rate was monitored in trained versus sedentary rats and mice demonstrating intrinsic bradycardia in response to exercise.176 Trained animals also showed downregulation of HCN4 and Tbx3 compared to controls.176 This study demonstrated for the first time that exercise training induces electrical remodelling in the SAN and that downregulation of HCN channels could be a direct cause of bradycardia.
