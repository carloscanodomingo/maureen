Given that sphingosine can induce apoptosis, and that sphingosine levels are increased in response to TNFa stimulation, links between sphingosine and the initiation of VSMC matrix mineralisation can be formed as both apoptosis and TNFa promote mineralisation (see section 1.5). Additionally, as sphingosine can inhibit the signalling activities of PKC, ERK and Akt, proteins that are implicated in VSMC matrix mineralisation (see section 1.6), further links between sphingosine and vascular calcification can be drawn. Therefore, sphingosine, like ceramide, may also have the potential to regulate vascular calcification.
1.10.1 S1P
S1P was first demonstrated to have signalling properties in 1990 when it was shown that this lipid activates the release of intracellular stored calcium (Ghosh et al. 1990). Further research then demonstrated that at the cellular level S1P could regulate cytoskeletal structure, promote proliferation and supress apoptosis (Sadahira et al. 1992; Olivera & Spiegel, 1993; Cuvillier et al. 1996). The levels of S1P are increased following the binding of growth factors (such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor) and cytokines (including TNFa and interleukins) to their respective receptors (Gandy & Obeid, 2013). S1P is also known to play many roles in cardiovascular processes including angiogenesis, the modulation of vascular tone and atherosclerotic plaque formation, although whether S1P is pro- or anti-atherogenic is unclear (Maceyka et al. 2012; Orr Gandy & Obeid, 2013; Levkau, 2013).

S1P is also implicated in bone homeostasis. For example, S1P induces chemotaxis and regulates the migration of osteoclast precursors from blood to bone in vivo, and thus regulates the precise location of bone absorption (Ishii et al. 2009). The effects of S1P on osteoclast precursor migration and localisation are mediated by S1P binding to the S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) and 2 (S1PR2) (Ishii et al. 2010). See below for more details on S1PRs. S1P has also been shown to inhibit the apoptosis of osteoblasts and induce proliferation, thus maintaining an active pool of osteoblasts within bone (Carpio et al. 1999; Grey et al. 2002). S1P induces proliferation in osteoblasts by activating the ERK signalling pathway and inhibits apoptosis by promoting PI3K signalling (Carpio et al. 1999; Grey et al. 2002). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in vitro that S1P can enhance the differentiation and mineralisation of MSC-derived osteoblasts and themineralisation of primary calvarial osteoblasts (Pederson et al. 2008; Lotinun et al. 2013; Keller et al. 2014). The enhanced mineralisation of calvarial osteoblasts was induced by S1P binding to S1PR1 and S1PR3 (Lotinun et al. 2013; Keller et al. 2014); the downstream effects of activating these receptors was not investigated so it is not known which signalling pathways mediate this effect. Collectively these finding suggest that S1P is pro-bone formation.

S1P can elicit its signalling affects both intracellularly and extracellularly. To date only two fully validated bona fide intracellular targets of S1P have been identified; S1P can inhibit the activity of histone deacetylase 1/2 in the nucleus thus regulating epigenetic changes (Hait et al. 2009) and activate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TNFa receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) in the cytoplasm downstream of TNFa stimulation (Alvarez et al. 2010). S1P exported from cells is found at high nM concentrations in human plasma (Ohkawa et al. 2008) where it binds lipoproteins (HDL, LDL & VLDL) and albumin (Levkau, 2013). S1P released extracellularly can also act in an  autocrine or paracrine fashion by activating five G-protein coupled receptors termed S1PR1-5, which is known as "inside-out" signalling (Strub et al. 2010). The majority of S1P signalling effects described to date are attributed to S1P binding to the S1PRs. Many studies have employed exogenous S1P to investigate both the intracellular and extracellular roles of S1P (Sato et al. 1997; Van Brocklyn et al. 1998).

The differential expression of S1PRs in different tissues and the coupling of these receptors to diverse a-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, including Gai, Gaq and  Ga12/13 proteins, can explain the diverse signalling potential of S1P (Strub et al. 2010). S1PR1 is coupled only to Gai, S1PR2 and S1PR3 are coupled to Gai, Gaq and Ga12/13, and S1PR4 and S1PR5 are coupled to Gai and Ga12/13 (Aarthi et al. 2011). As illustrated in Figure 1.11, signalling through Gai leads to the activation of Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways, Gaq signalling primarily activates phospholipase C/PKC and Ga12/13 promotes Rho/ROCK signalling (O'Sullivan & Dev, 2013). The activation of the Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways are thought to mediate the proliferation and pro- cell survival effects of S1P, whereas the activation of Rho/ROCK signalling is believed to regulate changes in cytoskeletal structure downstream of S1P (Hannun & Obeid, 2008). Like ceramide, S1P can also regulate the activity of the p38 MAPK signalling pathway and the activation of ERM proteins; see sections 1.11.1 and 1.11.2 for an overview of how S1P regulates these pathways.

Based on the information presented above with regards to S1P in cellular functions, links between S1P and the initiation of vascular calcification can be drawn. Given that S1P can enhance the osteogenic-differentiation of MSCs and increase the rate of osteoblast-mediated matrix mineralisation, S1P may also promote VSMC osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralisation. Thus S1P may be a promoter of vascular calcification. However, the addition of exogenous S1P can prevent apoptosis induced by increases in ceramide (Cuvillier et al. 1996) and promote the activation of pro-cell survival pathways such as ERK and Akt signalling (Hannun & Obeid, 2008). Therefore, S1P may acts as an inhibitor of vascular calcification by preventing the induction of apoptosis. Additionally, many of the downstream signalling pathways activated by S1P, such as ERK, Akt, ROCK, PKA, p38 MAPK and ERM proteins, are differentially regulated during VSMC matrix mineralisation (see section 1.6), further suggesting that S1P may regulate this pathological process. Thus, it appears that S1P has the potential to regulate vascular calcification but whether it acts as a promoter or inhibitor remains to be seen. CV10710 960
