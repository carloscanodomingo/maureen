1.1 PROGNOSIS
1.1.1 Mortality
The average time to death prior to the development of modern treatment strategies for patients with AAV was 5 months89, yet with advances in treatment, mortality rates have significantly improved with recent data for 1 year mortality reported as 11%90. Historically, reported outcomes for this patient group was largely confined to single-centre experience. However, in more recent years collaboration between centres on a national and international level has allowed for wider experience, with larger patient numbers to be published.

The first of these by the "Pan- Thames" group included patients presenting to 7 London hospitals with a new diagnosis of renal vasculitis between 1995 and 200091. 313 patients were included with the majority having a diagnosis of MPA 120 (49%) or GPA 82 (33%). Survival rates at 1 and 5 years were 84% and 76% respectively. Predictors for mortality were poorer renal function at presentation (with those presenting with end stage renal failure having a 5-year survival of 53%, p= 0.01) and age greater than 60 years (p=0.0002). Infection and leucopenia were the most common adverse events, with treatment induced leucopenia occurring in 99 (41%) of patients and being strongly associated with sepsis (p< 0.001). Seventy- three episodes of sepsis were reported (although it is not stated in how many patients they occurred), the presence of which were a predictor of mortality (p= 0.048) with the most common infection being pneumonia at 23 episodes (31.5%), followed by neutropenic sepsis at 12 episodes (16.4%) then herpes zoster virus at 11 episodes (15.1%). It should be noted that this study only included patients with renal involvement, and therefore this is likely to have had an impact upon mortality and possibly adverse events. There was no mention of adjustment of cyclophosphamide dose for renal function, but the majority of centres used oral therapy, compared with intravenous (2/7). Similarly, the French Vasculitis Group retrospectively analysed 595 patients with a diagnosis of MPA, Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis or Polyarteritis Nodosa diagnosed and treated between 1953 and 199992. 60 patients (10%) died in the first year following diagnosis with 33 (55%) of these deaths related to active vasculitis and 27 (45%) to infection. They also found that older age, renal involvement, and central nervous system involvement was predictive of mortality. Of note in this study is the extensive time period from which these patients were recruited, meaning that therapy was variable depending on the era in which patients were treated. Analysis by time of diagnosis showed that mortality has improved significantly since 1990, compared with patients presenting prior to this date (p< 0.01).

In 2007 the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Systemic Vasculitis Task Force also published a systematic review of outcome data from patients with AAV that included 44 studies. They reported 1-year survival rates of 85-97% in GPA, 82-92% in MPA and 93- 94% in EGPA. Five- year survival rates were only available for patients with GPA and reported as 75-88%93. Age and renal function were found once again to predict mortality but also the presence of damage, as measured by the Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI). The VDI is a validated assessment tool which records damage accrued not only due to vasculitis, but also due to treatment for the condition94.

In recent years, the European Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS) have completed a number of randomised controlled trials in patients with AAV to answer questions with regards to the efficacy of specific therapeutic options; CYCLOPS74, NORAM95, CYCAZAREM96, MEPEX73 and IMPROVE97 in addition to the Rituximab study outlined above. A combined review of outcomes for the first 4 of these studies has provided follow- up data for a median duration of 5.2 years in 535 patients98. The leading cause of death in the first year was infection at
47.5 % of deaths followed by active vasculitis at 18.6% then cardiovascular disease at 15.3%. After the first year, cardiovascular disease became the commonest cause of death at 25.7% followed by malignancy at 21.6%, with infection still contributing significantly at 20.3%. Significant predictors of mortality were the presence of both MPO and PR3 ANCA (dual positivity), age greater than 75 years and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 15mls/min (chronic kidney disease stage 5). There is currently data collection underway for the 10 year follow- up for this study which will provide more valuable long-term data for this cohort.

Specific to those patients with renal involvement, the Chapel Hill group has recently published outcomes for 554 patients with AAV with a median follow- up of 31 months99.This study, encompassing outcomes for patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2009, reported that renal function at diagnosis has improved over time; patients having a median eGFR of 11 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the earliest time period and 23 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the latest period. This would explain the observation that significantly fewer patients developed ESRD over time. There was no significant difference in the adjusted relapse rate over time with no factors identified associated with relapse (including ANCA type or duration of cyclophosphamide therapy). The authors suggested that this may be due to the inclusion of only those with renal involvement having received cyclophosphamide, therefore excluding many patients perhaps with airway limited PR3 associated disease. Data from other  sources additionally supports that generally outcomes from AAV are improving with a decline in Standardised Mortality Ratios from 2.1 to 1.03, in subsequent German vasculitis cohorts over a 36 years period64. However, it is clear that morbidity from treatment is still significant and ways of approaching prevention of this shall be addressed in later sections.
1.6.2 Relapse
The risk of disease relapse for patients with AAV appears to be in the order of 50%100,101(with follow- up over 44 months in 2 cohorts). One group's reports have suggested that relapse rates may be reducing, with a relapse rate of 35.3% in patients diagnosed from 1999 to 2002, compared with 51.2% of those diagnosed between 1994 and 199864. As mentioned above, however, the Chapel Hill study did not report an improvement in relapse rates with their 5-year relapse rate being 35%. Furthermore, longer term follow-up data from the CYCLOPS trial has shown that those treated with pulsed i.v. therapy were significantly more likely to have relapsed at follow-up (median duration 4.3 years) but this was not associated with a difference in mortality or morbidity between the two arms75. Other studies have shown the pattern of organ involvement to help predict relapse risk with respiratory involvement, cardiac involvement and lack of significant renal involvement (creatinine clearance >60ml/min) all being risk factors for relapse93,101. PR3 positivity has been recurrently demonstrated to be a risk factor for relapse102, however, the relationship between ANCA titres and relapse is complex and is discussed in more detail below.

Nasal carriage of Staph.aureus has been shown to be associated with a higher rate of disease relapse47 with treatment with co-trimoxazole shown to be efficacious in reducing relapse rates48. The mechanism behind this association is not as yet fully understood with roles for molecular mimicry, Toll Like receptors and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps all suggested as potential explanations103.
