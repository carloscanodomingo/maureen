2.1.10. Appraisals of the studies
One of the essential stages in a literature review is critical appraisal. It is a process of careful and systematic examination of the reviewed studies in order to judge their trustworthiness, value and relevance in a particular context (Green 2005, Mhaskar et al. 2009). The appraisal of all qualitative studies in the current review used a specific tool namely the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) (Tong et al. 2007). It is worth noting that the COREQ was developed to improve the quality of reporting qualitative studies, but it was deemed to be suitable to inform critical appraisal for the qualitative inquiries which mainly employed interview and focus groups as their data collection methods (Tong et al. 2007). Moreover, the tool also posed specificity regarding the appraisal questions therefore it could minimise wide interpretation for the reviewers as well as the readers. In addition, the researcher assessed the quality of survey studies on the basis of an article by Bennett et al. (2011) that reported an analysis of published guidance for survey research. The mixed studies were also assessed using the survey tool because the findings were mostly described quantitatively in nature.

2.1.10.1. Appraisal of the qualitative studies

Table 4 on the following page 55 details the score of appraisal for each qualitative study on 18 items covering three main aspects: research team and reflexivity, study design, and data analysis and reporting. None of the studies met the quality in every item, thus their quality scores were lower than 18, ranged from 5 to 14. Of the 25 reviewed studies, three were high, 14 were moderate and eight were low in their quality.

The appraisal relating to sampling covered three components; sampling methods, sample size and data saturation. Firstly, the majority of studies adopted a purposive sampling strategy. Theoretical sampling was employed in three studies (van der Voort et al. 2009, Copeland and Helleman 2011, and McHugh et al. 2012); allowing the researchers to use the emerging data during the processes of data collection and analysis so as to examine and elaborate the theories developed. Theoretical sampling is commonly used in grounded theory research in which the goal is to develop theories that are connected to, grounded in or emergent from real life events and circumstance (Marshall 1996, Higginbottom 2004, Corbin and Strauss 2008).

Secondly, the researcher examined the qualitative studies with regard to the sample size. The majority of the studies (i.e. 15 of the 25 studies) seemed to describe the sample size quantitatively. In this sense, the researchers acknowledged that one of the weaknesses of their studies was using a limited number of participants, thus compromising the transferability of the findings to other contexts. Nevertheless, it is argued that the aim of qualitative research is neither to count opinions nor people. Qualitative research aims to explore a range of perspectives about an issue; therefore approaches to sampling can be pragmatic and flexible (Gaskell 2000, O'Reilly and Parker 2012). Qualitative researchers believe that an adequate sample size is achieved when the research questions have been answered sufficiently (Marshall, 1996).

Thirdly, only five of the studies identified that theoretical saturation had been achieved (Domboos 2002, van der Voort et al. 2009, Nordby 2010, and Jonsson et al. 2011, Mizuno et al. 2103).The saturation occurs when the researcher has continued sampling and analysing data until no new data emerge and all concepts in the theory are developed thoroughly (Morse 2007). Information about the achievement of data saturation on a research paper is crucial, even though a small sample size is very common in qualitative studies. Detail about data saturation can inform the reader that the collected data has been adequate to answer the research question therefore any further data collection is not needed (Tong 2007, Trotter 2012).

With regard to the data collection, four studies did not show how the questions were derived for interviewing the participants (Johnson 2000, Bowes and Wilkinson 2003, McNeil 2013, and Wood et al. 2013). Likewise, most focus group studies did not present the questions used (Askey et al. 2009, Lyons et al. 2009, Nordy et al. 2010, Thomas 2010, Hacketal et al. 2012, and Wood et al. 2013). Questions presented in qualitative papers can facilitate the readers to examine whether or not the researchers have encouraged open conversations with the participants (Tong 2007).

In relation to the data analysis, most of the studies failed to describe the process of analysis adequately- particularly in relation as to how the data were coded. Only six studies provided clear descriptions by presenting a coding-tree i.e. a hierarchical arrangement of codes and sub-codes (van der Voort et al. 2009, Nordby et al. 2010, Weimand et al. 2011) or described the analysis stages in details (Rose et al. 2004, Mavundla et al. 2009, and Jonsson et al. (2011). According to Ryan et al. (2007) and Tong (2007), a clear description of how the themes are generated from the raw data is crucial because it may influence the credibility of qualitative research.

In addition, not all papers presented adequate quotations which might endanger the credibility of the studies (Tong et al. 2007). Eight of the 25 studies failed to identify which quotation belonged to which participant, even though the information is important to make judgements on how extent the researchers have over-used the words from particular articulate people (Corden and Sainsbury 2006). Furthermore, two studies (Johnson 2000 and White et al. 2013) failed to provide any participant quotes at all. A rich description of the phenomenon under investigation is essential because it can help the researchers to convey the actual situations that have been investigated and the context that surrounded them, and link between raw data and the emerging themes (Shenton 2003).NMS20606 953
