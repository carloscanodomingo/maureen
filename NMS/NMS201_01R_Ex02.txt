1.4.1 Differences between adult and baby skin
1.4.2 Extra care of baby skin is important due to differences in the biological composition between baby skin and adult skin. Skin starts to develop in-utero at approximately three weeks of gestation; the epidermis develops from surface ectoderm and consists of one layer of cells (Ackerman 1985). At term birth (37+0 weeks gestation) the skin is sufficiently developed to withstand extrauterine life; however it continues to change during the first twelve months after birth (Stamatas et al. 2010). Biophysical and biological properties such as corneocytes size, stratum corneum hydration and pH, lipid composition and structure, natural moisturising factor (NMF) and water composition continue to be in a state of transition during the early years of life (Fluhr et al.2011;Stamatas et al.2011;Nikolovski et al. 2008). Baby skin is more vulnerable than adult skin due to several differences. The stratum corneum is 30% thinner and the epidermis is 20% thinner in babies (Stamatas et al. 2010), which causes increased permeability and dryness. The neonatal body surface to body weight ratio is higher for babies than for adults, which results in an increased vulnerability to the use of topical treatments (Nikolovski et al. 2008). The differences in skin composition include less lipids, melanin and moisturising factors than adult skin, causing increased trans-epidermal water loss and reduced skin surface hydration in babies (Chiou and Blume-Peytavi 2004;Nakagawa et al. 2004). Baby skin also has a higher surface pH to adult skin (Yosipovitch et al. 2000), which results in an increase in protease activity in the breakdown of corneodesmosomes (the 'iron rods' of the stratum corneum; see figure 1.3), and hinders enzyme lipid processing (Danby and 2011;Hachem et al. 2003). Given that babies have a propensity for reduced skin barrier function, it is important that careful consideration is given to what topical products are used on baby skin to ensure that the developing epidermal barrier is not adversely altered or affected. Reduced skin barrier function and the development of atopic eczema are associated with alteration in the lipid composition and structure of the stratum corneum, a principal component of the epidermal barrier (Higgs-Bayliss et al.2014;Janssens et al. 2012; 2011). Baby skincare products should be proven to enhance the integrity, barrier and / or the immune system of baby skin before they are recommended to new parents to use on their newborn babies.

1.4.4 Differences between term and preterm baby skin
Babies are classed as preterm if they are born before 37 weeks of gestation. Preterm skin is thinner than for term babies, and is consequently more transparent (Lund and Kuller 2007). The stratum corneum is not visible in-utero until 34 weeks of gestation (Kalia et al. 1998;Evans and Rutter 1986). Although the stratum corneum consists of ten to twenty layers in term babies and adults, it has only two to three layers in preterm babies of less than 30 weeks gestation (Lund and Kuller 2007). The development of the skin barrier is more rapid after birth for preterm babies, and the stratum corneum can be equivalent to that of a term baby within two weeks of extrauterine life (Evans and Rutter 1986). This more rapid development is thought to result from the effect of the transition from wet to dry environment at birth. However other studies have reported that for babies born before 27 weeks gestation, this process is much slower (Agren et al. 1998;Kalia et al. 1998).
1.4.5 Vernix caseosa
Vernix caseosa is defined as a thick white greasy substance that 'varnishes' the baby skin at birth, functioning as a naturally occurring barrier film (Rissmann et al. 2006;Hoath et al. 2001;Holbrook and Hoff 1984). Vernix is composed of approximately 80% water and other lipid and protein elements (Hoeger and Enzmann 2002;Hoath et al. 2001). The layer of vernix often present at birth is formed in-utero. It forms as a result of sebaceous lipid synthesis and secretion, combined with in-utero desquamation of maturing fetal corneocytes (Hoath et al. 2001). The structure of vernix is therefore very similar to that of the stratum corneum (Rissmann et al. 2006).

The process of vernix formation begins at around week 24 of pregnancy gestation (Hardman et al. 1999) and production increases during the last trimester of pregnancy. Any baby born before 28 weeks of gestation has an immature epidermal barrier function and is likely to lack a sufficient coating of vernix. Largest amounts of vernix (approximately 70% coverage) are evident between 33 and 37 weeks of gestation. Babies have approximately 35% bodily coverage if born between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation, but only 10% coverage if born between 41 and 42 weeks of gestation (Visscher et al. 2005).

Preterm babies have a high trans-epidermal water loss. At birth, babies are typically dried to prevent further loss of water through evaporation. Any thin coating of vernix is therefore wiped away (Visscher et al. 2005). There is some suggestion that the proteins in vernix create an anti-microbial defence which may explain why preterm babies are more susceptible to nosocomial infections (Hoath et al. 2001).
There is a likelihood that vernix has some moisturising properties due to its high water content. It could therefore be expected that preterm babies born without a protective layer of vernix will have very dry skin. This could also explain why babies born after 40 weeks of gestation also suffer from very dry skin, as it is unusual to see a baby covered in vernix
born at late gestation (Visscher et al. 2005). This effect is magnified by the fact that the stratum corneum in healthy term babies has a propensity for dryness in any case. It is normal for babies to have dry skin (Saijo and Tagami 1991), but it is not known whether this process is secondary to the removal of vernix (Visscher et al. 2005).

Vernix is reported to be multi-functional; a protective barrier to bacteria (Tollin et al. 2005), a protective water-proofing barrier against the amniotic fluid (Youssef et al. 2001), and a natural moisturiser (Bautista et al. 2000). It is thought to be beneficial to leave vernix in place after birth and allow it to absorb or shed gradually (Tansirikongkol et al. 2007;Visscher et al. 2005). NMS20102 1022
