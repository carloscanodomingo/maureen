Even though all types of malnutrition pose health problems in children, stunting has the most unfavourable effects on child survival, optimal development and brain impairment (Devlin, 2012; UNICEF, 2009). Stunting reflects chronic nutritional deficiency associated with recurrent illness and inadequate nutrient intake over a long period of time (UNICEF et al., 2012). Wasting on the other hand often reflects a recent weight lost due to recent poor feeding during sickness, or a seasonal absence of food (UNICEF et al., 2012). Underweight represents either acute or chronic nutritional deficiency (UNICEF, 2012).
The percentage of children with a nutritional deficiency, for instance, stunting, in a population, indicates the growth and development status of children within that population. Poor child nutritional status represents a public health implication in a population, requiring attention. Table1.2 illustrates the indicators, the health significance parameters, and the value definitions. For instance, when less than 20% of children in a population suffer stunting, it is considered as low prevalence. However, forty percent (40%) of children with stunting in a population is considered very high prevalence and an undernutrition crisis with immediate and remote health and development implications.

1.4.2 The state of child nutrition in Ghana
Although there is evidence that most Ghanaian children are not receiving the minimum acceptable diet, there appears to be a significant decrease in the prevalence of under-nutrition in children under-five years in Ghana over the last 29 years (DGHS, 2015; MICS, 2011b) as Figure 1.1 illustrates. However, under-nutrition in Ghanaian children remains a public health concern because the prevalence of stunting is 28% in the ages 24-35 months. As indicated earlier, stunting is a manifestation of prolonged food deprivation, infections, and is an indication that children live in a challenging environment (UNICEF, 2016b; de Onis et al., 2006). This statistic, when compared with the WHO cut-off values of public health significance in Table 1.2 represents a serious public health concern (De Onis and WHO, 2006 & (MICS, 2011b).
Rural areas have the highest incidence of undernutrition in Ghana. For instance, in children under- five years in rural Ghana, stunting is 22% compared to 15% in urban Ghana. This makes stunting 7 percentage points higher in rural Ghana than in urban Ghana even though the population is evenly distributed with 50.9% living in urban areas and 49.1% in rural areas.

Stunting has remained persistently high in rural northern Ghana since 1988.

Furthermore, diet-related iron deficiency anaemia in children under-five presents a significant challenge in Ghana (MICS, 2011b). Anaemia is a condition in which there is a deficiency of red cells which carry haemoglobin in the blood, and which can be caused by bleeding, bone marrow deficiency, and dietary iron deficiency (Bagchi, 2004; Lloyd et al., 1978; Mbanya et al., 2007; Stoltzfus, 2001). Diseases such as malaria and worm infestation, and severe bacterial infections, can also cause anaemia (Mbanya et al., 2007; Smith and Haddad, 2000; Trail et al., 1991). However, the major cause of anaemia in children in Ghana is insufficient dietary iron (GDHS, 2003; GDHS, 2008b; MICS, 2011b). Iron is an essential mineral necessary for wellbeing and is particularly essential when there is rapid physiological development (Lloyd et al., 1978). This is because the availability of a derivative of iron (haemoglobin) in the blood impacts upon oxygen transport which is required for metabolism and other bodily processes which result in physical growth and development and strengthening of the immune system (Bagchi, 2004; Callender et al., 1957; Jacobs et al., 1972). Haemoglobin, a red pigment in the red blood cells is derived from dietary iron (Callender et al., 1957), and iron comes mostly from green leafy vegetables and animal products like fish, meat, and eggs (Guesry, 1998; Lloyd et al., 1978). Thus, the absence or low levels of these sources of iron in the diet will compromise bodily functions.

Whereas macro-nutrient deficiencies appear to be reducing amongst the under-fives in Ghana, anaemia seems to be increasing. Based on a periodic cross sectional test of haemoglobin levels in the blood of children under-five years, fifty-seven percent (57%) of the children in Ghana were suffering from anaemia in 2011 (MICS, 2011b). This increased to sixty-six percent (66%) four years later. Meanwhile, once more rural areas had a higher prevalence of anaemia, 73.6 %, compared with the urban areas with a prevalence of 57.3% (MICS, 2011b). Children's blood iron is one of the three micronutrients periodically monitored through the Ghana demographic and health survey (GSS et al., 2016). It could be argued that perhaps there is the equally high prevalence of deficiencies of other micronutrients which are not regularly monitored. This suggests that the impact of malnutrition may be more than known.

1.1. Impact of malnutrition
Under-nutrition is estimated to contribute to 40% of childhood deaths in Ghana (Birks, 2012; UNICEF, 2009; UNICEF, 2014). Children who survive chronic under-nutrition are often left with problems such as cognitive impairment, low intelligence quotient (IQ), reduced capacity to do physical work and implications for personal and national development (UNICEF, 2016b; Pelletier et al., 1995). With reduced physical and intellectual capacity, these children may not be able to reach their adult potential. This could then reduce their ability to contribute meaningfully to the economic growth and development of their country (Grantham-McGregor et al., 2007; Guesry, 1998).

Additionally, when malnutrition is high, a healthcare system is overburdened with caring for the health needs of malnourished children, and parents and guardians' productive time is lost to the care of sick children (World Bank, 2010). In fact, it is reported that anaemia alone causes an approximate drop of 2.5% in wages in Ghana (World Bank, 2010). It is also estimated that Ghana loses up to 177 million Ghana cedis of its gross domestic product (GDP) to vitamin and mineral deficiencies (World Bank, 2010). These burdens of malnutrition exist regardless of the many interventions put in place in Ghana to address this issue. It is accepted that optimal feeding practices could make a difference (Gyampoh et al., 2014; GDHS, 2008a). Unfortunately, the evidence shows that feeding practices are not optimal in Ghana (GSS et al., 2016; Gyampoh et al., 2013a; Gyampoh et al., 2014) but the explanation for this lack of optimal feeding is sparse.NMS20202 1020
