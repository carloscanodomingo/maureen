Types of studies: studies using a comparison to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness in preventing and controlling acute and/or delayed nausea and/or vomiting. Studies which considered prophylactic intervention or treatment in response to post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting. 2. Types of participants: adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. 3. Types of interventions: non-pharmacological CAM interventions, including: acupuncture, acupressure, and psycho-behavioural techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, cognitive or attentional distraction, hypnosis (passive relaxation), guided-relaxation imagery and music therapy 4. Types of outcome measures: acute or delayed CINV, or both.
