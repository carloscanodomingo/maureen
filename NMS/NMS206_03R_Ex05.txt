2.1.1.1. Characteristics of the reviewed studies
Of the 40 included papers, the majority were based in Western countries i.e. 11 in the US, nine in the UK, five in Australia, two in Netherlands, two in Norway, two in Italy, one in Canada, one in Germany, and one in Sweden. Only six articles were based in non-western countries; two from China, two from Taiwan, one from Japan, and one from South Africa.

Of these studies, 25 had samples of carers only, and 15 of them used mixed samples including carers and service users (n=7); carers, service users, and professionals (n=7); and carers and professionals (n=1). The total sample size of carer participants of all studies was 3099. Samples of the carer participants varied from four carers in two studies (Wood et al. 2003 and Wilkinson and McAndrew 2005) and 746 carers in the Friedrich et al. (2008).


2.1.9.1.1. Methodological design
25 of the 40 studies were qualitative, 12 were quantitative and three were mixed studies. Out of the 25 qualitative investigations, 16 did not report the specific methodology adopted. The remaining studies employed various methodologies including grounded theory (n=3), content analysis (n=2), ethnography (n=2), case studies (n=2), ad social interactionist (n=1). In terms of the methods of collecting the qualitative data, 15 used individual interviews, nine adopted focus groups, and one study examined written qualitative data from carer participants.

Of the 12 quantitative studies, all were questionnaire surveys. In relation to the questionnaire used, the majority of the 12 surveys used established recognised questionnaires, including:
* The Educational Needs Questionnaire (ENQ)

* The Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Appraisal Schedule (CANSAS)

* The Family Assessment of Needs for Services (FANS)

* The	Relatives	Cardinals	Needs	Schedule	(RCNS),	Needs	Assessment	of Caregivers/Families questionnaire from Salford Mental Health Project 1985,
* The Friedrich-Lively Instrument to Assess the Impact of Schizophrenia on Siblings (FLIISS),
* The Degree of Congruence between Attributes of Home Care Services Desired and Received Questionnaire (DCAHCSDRQ),
* A standardized Carer assessment by Gloucestershire Partnership NHS Trust (2003).

Some modified/self-developed questionnaires were also used:

* Chinese Modified Educational Needs Questionnaire (CENQ)

* Italian version of Camberwell Assessment of Need (ICAN),

* The Carers' Needs Assessment for Schizophrenia (CAN-S).

All of the three mixed studies also employed surveys for their quantitative investigations. For example, studies by Jubb and Shanley (2002) and Lloyd and Carson (2005) posted written open-ended questions in a questionnaire to obtain data for their mixed methods.


2.1.9.1.2. Characteristics of participants

The relationships of carer participants to members of the family with a serious mental health problem were identified in 25 studies. The majority of the carer participants were siblings (n=1061), followed by parents (n=1051) spouses/partners (n=171), adult children (n=79) and others (n=47). Six studies used specific participants to investigate the needs of specific group of carers, such as female carers, siblings, spouses or parents.

2.1.9.2.	Results of synthesis
The first stage of the synthesis (i.e. the development of descriptive themes), resulted in some categories of carer needs including informational, emotional, practical and professional support. The need for information was dominant and found in 32 of the 40 studies. This need focused around carers needing knowledge about mental health problems (e.g. signs, symptoms and treatments), the progress of their relative with mental health problems, and the mental health services available. In addition, carers in three studies (Ascher-Svanum et al. 1997, Drapalski et al. 2008, and Askey et al. 2009) suggested that information should be individualised and tailored to the specific circumstances of each family and offered at an appropriate pace, particularly in the early stages of the mental health problem. Twenty-one studies revealed data outlining needs of emotional and practical supports. Six studies uncovered the need for professional support and emphasised that carers wanted to be respected, listened to and for health workers to demonstrate empathy. Finally, the need for carer involvement emerged in nine of the 40 studies, specified as the desire of carers to be treated as part of team care, consulted regarding decisions made for service users and acknowledged as experts.[Table 3 removed]

The similarities and differences between the categories were then identified and grouped into a hierarchical structure. Seven major themes including the sub-themes were revealed to describe what was needed by carers from services as depicted in Table 3.

Other similarities and differences were also identified with regard to the needs of carers across some cultures, described as western - represented by carers living in the North of America, Europe and Australia, and non-western -- represented by carers living in Asia and Africa (see the detail on the previous page 47). Several needs including the needs of information, emotional support, supportive attitudes of professionals, and practical support were voiced in the studies which were based in both western and non-western cultures. Nonetheless, while the needs of adequate wellbeing for carers and involving them in the services were expressed profoundly in the USA, Canada, and Europe; these needs did not emerge from the investigations with Asians and Africans.
The second stage of the synthesis (i.e. the development of analytical themes) involved advanced interpretation of the original studies. It included collapsing some themes into another existing theme as presented in the previous Table 3. To illustrate, the need of information and emotional support were grouped under another theme namely the need of adequate wellbeing of carers - at the end this theme was labelled as the need of holistic wellbeing of carers. In addition, this phase involved a re-examination of the data to ensure that the themes were represented. For example, the data related to improvement of services were re-examined and grouped together with the data of the need of practical support under a new theme: the need of holistic wellbeing of service users. The result of this stage was identification of four major needs of carers: (1) holistic wellbeing of service users, (2) holistic wellbeing of carers, (3) supportive attitudes of professionals and (4) carer involvement.
A further analysis resulted in a notion in that the needs (1) and (2) which were consecutively closely associated with the wellbeing of service users and carers, and needs (3) and (4) which have indirect connections to the wellbeing of carers or service users, as shown in Figure 5.[Fig 5 removed]
Finally, the current synthesis could describe the relationship between the emerging themes. A deeper analysis of the data related to the needs of supportive attitudes of professionals (3) and carer involvement (4) suggested that these were voiced because the carers wanted the best services to be given to their ill relatives. Likewise, many carers reported that they required information because they wanted to be more knowledgeable and skilled in caring for service users. Therefore, it can be assumed that the whole 4 carer needs uncovered in this review were actually dedicated to their ill relatives, as illustrated in Figure 6. [Fiig 6 removed]
